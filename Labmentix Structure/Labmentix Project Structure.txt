General Guidelines : -  
1. Well-structured, formatted, and commented code is required.

2. Exception Handling, Production Grade Code & Deployment Ready Code will be a plus. Those students will be awarded some additional credits. The additional credits will have advantages over other students during Star Student selection.
   [ Note: - Deployment Ready Code is defined as, the whole .ipynb notebook should be executable in one go without a single error logged. ]

3. Each and every logic should have proper comments.

4. You may add as many number of charts you want. Make Sure for each and every chart the following format should be answered.    
    Chart visualization code:    
    - Why did you pick the specific chart?
    - What is/are the insight(s) found from the chart?
    - Will the gained insights help creating a positive business impact?
    - Are there any insights that lead to negative growth? Justify with specific reason.

5. You have to create at least 15 logical & meaningful charts having important insights.
    [ Hints : - Do the Visualization in  a structured way while following "UBM" Rule.
      U - Univariate Analysis,
      B - Bivariate Analysis (Numerical - Categorical, Numerical - Numerical, Categorical - Categorical)
      M - Multivariate Analysis
    ]

6. You may add more ml algorithms for model creation. Make sure for each and every algorithm, the following format should be answered.

  - Cross- Validation & Hyperparameter Tuning
  - Have you seen any improvement? Note down the improvement with updates Evaluation metric Score Chart.
